                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                        with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
                        itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                        faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>

                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

                <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
                <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
                <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
                <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
