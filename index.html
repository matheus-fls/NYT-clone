                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                        with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
                        itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                        faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

                <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
